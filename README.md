# Understanding Analysis Solutions

These are unofficial solutions for Understanding Analysis by Stephen Abbott. I started writing these solutions, when I was self-studying and taking a first course in real analysis, and felt that I might as well give the problems an effort by writing out solutions.

# Why should I read this?
While the official solutions may be more accurate, they may be terse and sometimes hard to understand, so a different perspective may help. Introductory Real Analysis is a visual topic, so I've drawn tiny pictures wherever possible to get a gut, intuitive feel of what's going on. In addition, my proofs were done mostly independent of the official solutions.
